#Question 1
Done and done!

#Question 2
```{r Getting the ball rolling}
#Calling libraries#
library(tidyverse)
library(rpart.plot)
library(rpart)
library(hablar)

#Reading in the csv files#
crime10csv <- read_csv("crimedata10.csv")
crimecsv <- read_csv("crimedata.csv")
crimecsv %>% convert(int(ExpenditureYear), lgl(BelowWage), int(StateSize), dbl(Education), lgl(HighYouthUnemploy), dbl(Wage))
```


```{r Build a tree}

```


```{r }

```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
